# Amstrad CPC SNA File Analyzer

This HTML and JavaScript script provides a tool to analyze Amstrad CPC state snapshot files (.sna).

By loading a .sna file, the script extracts and displays the contents of its header, including the Z80 CPU registers, CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller) settings, and Gate Array configuration. It decodes the values to show the estimated screen resolution, RAM bank mapping, and color palette.

Simply open the all-in-one html file in a web browser, and open a SNA file.
